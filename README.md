Vidor Libraries monorepo
========================

* This repository contains all the libraries and scripts needed by MKRVidor4000.

* Folders description:
	- VidorUtils: implements basic communication primitives; it is recommended to derive any specialized class from this one
		- /extras: contains everything you could need while developing/prototyping your own IP. Every tools comes with a README in its own folder

	- VidorBase: collects all the basic funcionalities from I/O libraries
		- /src/app.ttf: this is the FPGA bitstream that will be flashed once VidorBase.h is included in a sketch; it is generated by VidorUtils/extras/createCompositeBinary project
		- /src/VidorBase.cpp: implements basic overloads of classic Arduino APIs (digitalRead, pinMode, etc)

	- VidorBoot: placeholder library to allow reflashing the FPGA "bootloader". Follow the instruction in that folder to factory restore the FPGA flash functionalities

	- VidorUART: implements advanced UART functionalities; automatically included in all the libraries that contain bitstreams implementing UARTs

	- VidorSPI: implements advanced SPI functionalities; automatically included in all the libraries that contain bitstreams implementing SPIs

	- VidorI2C: implements advanced I2C functionalities; automatically included in all the libraries that contain bitstreams implementing I2Cs

	- VidorGFX: implements graphics functionalities modeled over Adafruit_GFX to allow an easier porting of existing sketches

	- VidorCam: implements a driver for Omnivision OV5647 camera

	- VidorQR: implements a QR code marker recognition using images from an OV5647 camera

	- VidorEncoder: implements a decoder for quadrature encoders


* How libraries are generated:


	Since only a single library (implementing a bitstream) can be included at a time, we provide a script to automatically create a "final" library starting from the given sublibraries. This "fat" library is uploaded to http://github.com/vidor-libraries so it can be retrieved by the Library Manager. All the repositories there are readonly, the development only happens in this repo.
